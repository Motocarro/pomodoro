# Pomodoro.

## Introduction:
The Pomodoro App is a simple iOS app that helps users stay focused and increase productivity.
The app is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break.

## Requirements:
iPhone:
- iOS 16.0 or newer.

iPad:
- iPadOS 16.0 or newer;
- An A-Series chip (or at least it was not tested on any, YMMV).

Mac:
- An M-Series based Mac (emulating the iPad app).

Vision Pro:
- VisionOS 1.0 or newer (emulating the iPad app);
- Why are you even looking at this?

### Features:

  - Timer for 25-minute work sessions
  - Timer for 5-minute breaks
  - Simple and intuitive interface
  - Reminders on pause time
  - Background App Refresh

### Usage:

- Start the app and begin a work session by touching the screen
- Work on your task without any distractions during the set time
- Take a break when the timer goes off
- Repeat the cycle to stay focused and productive

### Note:
This is my first attempt at creating a Pomodoro app, and I'm excited to share it with you. 
Please keep in mind that I'm still learning, and I may not be able to provide extensive support or resolve issues quickly. 
However, if you encounter any problems or have suggestions, you can still open an issue request [here](https://github.com/motocarro/pomodoro/issues). 
I'll do my best to address them, but I appreciate your patience and understanding.

Also, note that this code is protected under the GNU GPL v3.0 (see the other tab for info).

Thanks!
